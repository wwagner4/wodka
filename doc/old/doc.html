                                be configured. The results of the breeding process can be saved to resume breeding at a later time or exported to be viewed in 
                                the soda constructor or racer.

                                        <h1>theory - questions</h1>
                                        <p>In this chapter I ask questions, that occurred before or during the 
                    wodka project. Then I answer the questions to illustrate the solutions that where chosen 
                    in this project.</p>
                                        <p>Q: What could be the phenotype of an arbitrary 2D structure in general?</p>
                                        <p>A: It must be some kind of sequence on which genetic operations 
                    can be applied, and it must be possible to generate exactly one structure from 
                    this sequence. In eather words: There must be non-ambiguous mapping from the sequence to
                    the structure. Another important requirement of this mapping is, that it must be 
                    local. This means that sequences that do not differ a lot should lead to structures that
	                does not differ a lot ether.</p>
                                        <p>Q: What kind of sequences where chosen for wodka?</p>
                                        <p>A: In wodka I have chosen the Principe of building languages.
                    A language is a set of commands that might have parameters. A sequence of commands represent
                    a program of this language.
                    For each language exists an interpreter that manages the mapping from a program to a structure.</p>
                                        <p>Q: What kind of languages are used in wodka?</p>
                                        <p>A: At the moment two kinds of languages are used. An assembler like
                    language and a group of languages that use a command set much like the well known turtle
                    graphics.</p>
                                        <p>Q: How does the assembler like language look like?</p>
                                        <p>It consists from two commands. AddMass(x,y) and AddSpring(i,j). 
                        AddMass adds a mass at the position (x,y) to the structure. AddSpring adds a spring from
                        the i-th mass to the j-mass.</p>
                                        <p>Q: What means mass and spring in this context?</p>
                                        <p>A: The expressions mass and spring are taken form sodarace. In general
                    they mean node and connection.</p>
                                        <p>Q: What do the turtle languages look like?</p>
                                        <p>A: They consist of the commands PenUp(), PenDown(), Forward(l) and Turn(a).
                    These commands control a pen that draws a structure. Forward draws a line of length l if 
                    the pen is currently down. PenUp and PenDown lower and rise the pen. Turn turns the 
                    drawing direction of the pen for a certain angle. At the moment turtle languages
                    are implemented that use different grids width. </p>
                                        <p>Q: How can the genetic algorithm be tested as long as no soda races are available?</p>
                                        <p>A: I implemented a set of racers that favorite structures that are 
                    alike a certain structure. Using these racers show a progress from random structures
                    to structures that are more and more like the pattern structure.</p>
                                        <p>Q: How does the GA perform ?</p>
                                        <p>A: It performs well in generating simple structures like squares but does not really
                    find complex structures. I am not sure if this is the fault of the GA. The results show a strong 
                    dependency of how the fitness function is defined. Improperly designed fitness functions 
                    direct the GA into local maximums where it gets stuck.</p>

                                        <p>The building language is a genotype for soda robots. 
                    It consists of a sequence of commands called a program. On such a program genetic operations can be applied.
                    For every building language must also exist an interpreter. Evaluation of a program on that
                    interpretor generates a model that can be tested for fitness.</p>

                                        <h3>recombination</h3>
                                        <p>Recombination of two programs means to take a random length sequence of commands from from
                    the first. Then switch to the same position of the second program and take also a random
                    length sequence of commands. Appending those pieces of programs builds a new program that
                    represents a new model.</p>

                                        <h3>assembler</h3>
                                        <p>Assembler is an assembler like building language consisting of two commands. 
                    AddMass(x,y) and AddSpring(indexFromMass,indexToMass). A sequence of these two commands 
                    may define a wodka model if it is evaluated by an interpreter.</p>
                                        <h3>turtle</h3>
                                        <p>The turtle building language exists of the commands Forward(l), Turn(a), PenUp() and PenDown().
                    Evaluation always starts in the middle of a building area with the turtle orientated up (north). 
                    Forward generates Two masses and a muscle of length l if the pen is down. 
                    The turtle is moved to the endpoint of the muscle. If the pen is down the turtle just 
                    walks around until the next PenDown() command. Turn turns the turtle for a certain
                    angle without moving it. PenDown -Up activates/deactivates the construction of muscles.</p>

                                        <h3>phenotype models</h3>
                                        <p>Models are representation of soda robots. They build from masses, muscles and general parameters. 
                    Masses are defined by 
                    their absolute position inside a square area. The hight and width of this area 
                    are currently 256 pixel. Muscles are defined as connections between 
                    masses and parameters. The length is defined by the distance of the endpoint masses.
                    The general parameters are amplitude and phase known from the soda constructor.</p>
                                        <p>The role of the model in wodka is to be the phenotype that can be tested for fitness 
                    on the soda race application.</p>

                                        <h3>genotype</h3>
                                        <p>In order to run a genetic algorithm you have to have a so called genotype 
                    that has the capability build a phenotype by means of a mapping function. Like
                    living creatures have their genes from which new creatures can 'build'.</p>
                                        <p>Another important capability of genotypes is that the genetic operations crossover and mutation can be applied
                    on them.</p>

                                        <h3>genetic algorithm</h3>
                                        <p>Breeding models requires a genetic algorithm (GA). The GA contains a 
                    population of genotypes. From each of these genotypes one model (phenotype) is generated and tested for
                    its fitness. That means it has to run a race on the soda race application. The fitness is a value that indicates
                    how fast it reaches the end of the race or how many percent it finished.
                    The test of models result in a fitnesses for each member of the population.</p>
                                        <p>After testing the models, selection is applied to the population to generate
                    a new population. During the selection process the genetic operations can be applied to
                    form new individuals. Generally the fittest are selected to form a new population.</p>
                                        <p>With that new population the process starts from the beginning.</p>
